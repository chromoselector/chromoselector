* Regular License

The Regular License grants you, the Purchaser a non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to make use of the work that you acquire (Work).

Your use of the Work, under the Regular License, is subject to the following conditions:

    Your use of the Work is limited to a single application.

    Where the Work is an installable software application designed to help perform singular specific tasks, the use of the Work is limited to a single concurrent usage. In these cases, the “single application” of the Work is its installation. Examples of Works where the output can be used on many projects as long as only one copy of the Works is running at any one time are:
        Flash .MXP (extension)
        PhotoShop .ABR (brushes)
        PhotoShop .GRD (gradient)
        PhotoShop .PAT (pattern)
        PhotoShop .ASL (style layer)
        PhotoShop .ATN (action)
        PhotoShop .CSH (custom shape)
        TrueType .TTF (font)
        OpenType .OFT (font)
        PostScript .PFM (font)

    You may use the Work alone or you may incorporate the Work into another work you are creating.

    You must not directly or indirectly license, sub-license, sell or resell the Work, or redistribute the Work alone (even for free), or offer to do any of these things. All of these things are referred to as Resale.

    You may reproduce the Work
        in a printed format or;
        on a website or;
        in an electronic document such as a PowerPoint presentation or an eBook or;
        as part of software you create or;
        in a video production or;
        for sound effects only, in a stand-alone music track.

    You may use the Work in a work which you are creating for your own purposes or for your client who has asked you to create it.

    You must not incorporate the Work in a work which is created for Resale by you or your client.

    If the Work is used or incorporated in a work there is no restriction on the number of copies of that work that can be reproduced and distributed (provided the use/incorporation remains a single application and the copies are not for Resale).

    For example, you may incorporate the Work, such as a graphic, in a brochure you design for your client. An unlimited number of copies of the brochure incorporating the Work may be made but the Work cannot be incorporated in any other application. The brochures must be distributed to recipients at no charge to the recipient.

    Notwithstanding the restriction on Resale, if you acquire the Work on behalf of your client you may recoup from your client the cost of acquiring the Work.

    If the whole, or part, of the Work has been created using materials which are the subject of a GNU General Public License (GPL), your use of the Work (or part Work) is subject to the specific terms of the GPL in place of the foregoing conditions (to the extent the GPL applies).

    If the Work contains component items, those items must only be used within the Work and you must not extract and use them on a stand-alone basis.

    For example, if a website template contains photos, those photos can only be used within the website installation; you must not copy those photos outside of the website you install from the template.

* Extended License

The Extended License grants you, the Purchaser, a non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to make use of the work you acquire (Work).

Your use of the Work, under the Extended License, is subject to the following conditions:

    Your use of the Work is limited to a single application.

    You may use the Work alone (subject to paragraph (c)) or you may incorporate the Work into another work you are creating.

    You may license, sub-license, sell, resell or re-distribute the Work or offer to do any of these things (together referred to as Resale) in the following circumstances:
        the Work is incorporated into a larger work you have created; or
        if the Work is a template or software application, you use it alone to modify it and Resell it as an end product (that is, not as a tool, template, or stock item, and without source files); or
        you use the Work alone as a Limited Re-Purposing, but only if: (A) you first obtain the permission of the author of the Work; and (B) the Resale of the second work is only made on an Envato marketplace. A Limited Re-Purposing means that you use the Work alone and modify it for Re-sale as a tool, template, or stock item, or with source files.

    See our KnowledgeBase for examples of these uses. Examples of Limited Re-Purposing include: A conversion of an html website template to a different format such as WordPress; a conversion of a PSD template to a website theme; converting a graphic item to a functional version of the item; or colour, font, positioning, background variations to items.

    You may reproduce the Work:
        in a printed format or;
        on a website or;
        in an electronic document such as a PowerPoint presentation or an eBook or;
        as part of software you create or;
        in a video production or;
        for sound effects only, in a stand-alone music track.

    You may use the Work in a work which you are creating for your own purposes or for your client who has asked you to create it.

    You may incorporate the Work in a work which is created for Resale by you or your client (provided that (i) only the complete work is offered for sale, (ii) where technically possible, you must ensure the Work cannot be extracted as a stand-alone item from the second work, and (ii) the terms of sale prohibit the buyer extracting or re-using the Work as a stand-alone item).

    You may display the Work, and make the Work available for use by an unlimited number of your clients, in conjunction with a web site service that you host on behalf of your clients. When using the Work through a web site service, you may make unlimited copies of the Work but you must procure that your clients do not reproduce or use the Work in another application.

    If the Work is used or incorporated in a work there is no restriction on the number of copies of that work that can be reproduced and distributed.

    For example: you may incorporate the Work, such as a music file, in a sound mixing software program that you or your client distributes commercially. An unlimited number of copies of the software program may be made and sold but the Work cannot be incorporated in more than one software program or other work. Additionally, buyers of the software program must not offer the Work (that is the music file) for sale, such as on a site like AudioJungle.net

    Notwithstanding the restriction on Resale, if you acquire the Work on behalf of your client you may recoup from your client the cost of acquiring the Work.

    If the whole, or part, of the Work has been created using materials which are the subject of a GNU General Public License (GPL), your use of the Work (or part Work) is subject to the specific terms of the GPL in place of the foregoing conditions (to the extent the GPL applies).

    If the Work contains component items, those items must only be used within the Work and you must not extract and use them on a stand-alone basis.

    For example, if a magazine template contains photos, those photos can only be used within the end magazine product; you must not copy those photos outside of the magazine you create.
